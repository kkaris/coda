B85.1,Pediculosis due to Pediculus humanus corporis,"Body-louse infestation; Pediculosis due to Pediculus humanus corporis. <h3>What are body lice?</h3> <p>Body lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed.</p> <p>Body lice are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/headlice.html"">head lice</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/pubiclice.html"">pubic lice</a>. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.</p> <p>Body lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.</p> <h3>How do body lice spread?</h3> <p>Body lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for body lice?</h3> <p>Body lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/homelessnessandhealth.html"">people experiencing homelessness</a>. In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of body lice?</h3> <p>The most common symptom of body lice is intense <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/itching.html"">itching</a>. There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html"">bacteria</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/fungalinfections.html"">fungi</a>.</p> <p>If someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs).</p> <h3>How do you know if you have body lice?</h3> <p>A diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for body lice?</h3> <p>The main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine.</p> <p class="""">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>",MEDLINEPLUS,True,5

Diagnosis may be suspected after the age of six months when a child's own synthesis of IgG should accelerate but it must be confirmed retrospectively after normalization of all serum immunoglobulin levels is seen by ages 2-6. This disorder may be caused by inadequate activation of progenitor B cells, defective class-switching or may even represent a maturational variant. Typically, a normal response to protein antigens is found while there is a notably diminished response to viral and bacterial polysaccharide antigens.

D81.3,Adenosine deaminase [ADA] deficiency,"Adenosine deaminase [ADA] deficiency. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a disorder that affects the immune system. Specifically, ADA deficiency impairs the development and function of immune cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight infections. As a result, people with ADA deficiency often develop pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Additional signs and symptoms of ADA deficiency include slow growth and developmental delays.~About 80 percent of individuals with ADA deficiency also have severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by ""opportunistic"" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. People with ADA deficiency with SCID (ADA-SCID) typically develop health problems within the first 6 months of life. Without treatment, these babies usually do not survive past age 2.~About 15 to 20 percent of people with ADA deficiency develop health problems that begin between 1 and 10 years of age (delayed onset) or in adulthood (late onset). In people with this form of ADA deficiency (known as delayed or late-onset combined immunodeficiency or ADA-CID), the immune deficiency tends to be less severe than in people with ADA-SCID. People with ADA-CID typically have recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. Over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition, and other health problems.~In some individuals, ADA deficiency only impacts red blood cells. Since white blood cells are not affected, these individuals have normal immune systems. This form of the condition is known as partial ADA deficiency. Individuals with this form do not have any health problems related to the condition.

Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.~Androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions, including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate.

Intervertebral disc disease is a common condition characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of one or more of the discs that separate the bones of the spine (vertebrae), causing pain in the back or neck and frequently in the legs and arms. The intervertebral discs provide cushioning between vertebrae and absorb pressure put on the spine.~While the discs in the lower (lumbar) region of the spine are most often affected in intervertebral disc disease, any part of the spine can have disc degeneration. Depending on the location of the affected disc or discs, intervertebral disc disease can cause periodic or chronic pain in the back or neck. Pain is often worse when sitting, bending, twisting, or lifting objects.~Degenerated discs are prone to out-pouching (herniation); the protruding disc can press against one of the spinal nerves that run from the spinal cord to the rest of the body. This pressure causes pain, weakness, and numbness in the back and legs. Herniated discs often cause nerve pain called sciatica that travels along the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down the length of each leg.~As a disc degenerates, small bony outgrowths (bone spurs) may form at the edges of the affected vertebrae. These bone spurs may pinch (compress) the spinal nerves, leading to weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. If the bone spurs compress the spinal cord, affected individuals can develop problems with walking and bladder and bowel control. Over time, a degenerating disc may break down completely and leave no space between vertebrae, which can result in impaired movement, pain, and nerve damage.",MEDLINEPLUS,True,4

Q39.1,Atresia of oesophagus with tracheo-oesophageal fistula,"Atresia of esophagus with tracheo-esophageal fistula; Atresia of oesophagus with tracheo-oesophageal fistula; Atresia of esophagus with broncho-esophageal fistula. Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a condition resulting from abnormal development before birth of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (the esophagus). During early development, the esophagus and windpipe (trachea) begin as a single tube that normally divides into the two adjacent passages between four and eight weeks after conception. If this separation does not occur properly, EA/TEF is the result.~In esophageal atresia (EA), the upper esophagus does not connect (atresia) to the lower esophagus and stomach. Almost 90 percent of babies born with esophageal atresia also have a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), in which the esophagus and the trachea are abnormally connected, allowing fluids from the esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing. A small number of infants have only one of these abnormalities.~There are several types of EA/TEF, classified by the location of the malformation and the structures that are affected. In more than 80 percent of cases, the lower section of the malformed esophagus is connected to the trachea (EA with a distal TEF). Other possible configurations include having the upper section of the malformed esophagus connected to the trachea (EA with a proximal TEF), connections to the trachea from both the upper and lower sections of the malformed esophagus (EA with proximal and distal TEF), an esophagus that is malformed but does not connect to the trachea (isolated EA), and a connection to the trachea from an otherwise normal esophagus (H-type TEF with no EA).~While EA/TEF arises during fetal development, it generally becomes apparent shortly after birth. Saliva, liquids fed to the infant, or digestive fluids may enter the windpipe through the tracheoesophageal fistula, leading to coughing, respiratory distress, and a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). Esophageal atresia blocks liquids fed to the infant from entering the stomach, so they are spit back up, sometimes along with fluids from the respiratory tract. EA/TEF is a life-threatening condition; affected babies generally require surgery to correct the malformation in order to allow feeding and prevent lung damage from repeated exposure to esophageal fluids.~EA/TEF occurs alone (isolated EA/TEF) in about 40 percent of affected individuals. In other cases it occurs with other birth defects or as part of a genetic syndrome (non-isolated or syndromic EA/TEF).",MEDLINEPLUS,True,5

Q77.7,Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia,"Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) congenita is a disorder of bone development that causes short stature with a particularly short torso and short arms and legs. The parts of the body are not proportional to one another (disproportionate short stature) in people with this condition. Affected individuals typically have hands and feet that are of average size. SED congenita affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and the ends (epiphyses) of the long bones in the arms and legs. People with this condition also have problems with vision and hearing. The word ""congenita"" indicates that the condition is often noticeable at birth. The signs and symptoms of SED congenita can vary among affected individuals.~People with SED congenita have an adult height that ranges from 3 feet to almost 5 feet. Affected individuals may develop abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis), which can worsen during childhood. Instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck can cause these bones to shift, which increases the risk of damage to the spinal cord.~Other skeletal issues in individuals with SED congenita can include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara), and inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfoot). Arthritis and decreased joint mobility often develop early in life. An abnormally short, broad, and barrel-shaped chest can cause problems with breathing. People with SED congenita may also have breathing problems due to weakness of the windpipe.~SED congenita often causes mild differences in facial features such as underdeveloped cheek bones (malar hypoplasia). Some affected individuals have a particular group of physical features called Pierre Robin sequence, which includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Severe nearsightedness (high myopia) is common in SED congenita, as are other eye problems that can impair vision such as a tearing of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal detachment). Some people with SED congenita have hearing loss.~Some disorders, such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with premature-onset arthrosis and Namaqualand type hip dysplasia, are similar to SED congenita but have milder signs and symptoms. These milder conditions were once thought to be separate disorders, but they are now considered to be part of SED congenita. People with these disorders typically have joint pain and stiffness, which can restrict movement. Symptoms can begin in childhood and often worsen over time.",MEDLINEPLUS,True,4
